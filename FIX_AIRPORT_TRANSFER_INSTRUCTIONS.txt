AIRPORT TRANSFER BOOKING FIX - MIGRATION INSTRUCTIONS
====================================================

The airport transfer booking error has been identified and fixed. The issue was a missing 'flight_number' column in the bookings table.

WHAT WAS FIXED:
1. âœ… Added flight_number field to Booking model's fillable array
2. âœ… Added explicit flight_number assignment in BookingController
3. âœ… Created migration to add flight_number column to database

TO COMPLETE THE FIX:
====================

1. Open your terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to your project directory:
   cd C:\xampp\htdocs\safarikonnect\safarriconnect

3. Run the migration to add the flight_number column:
   php artisan migrate

4. Clear any cached configuration (optional but recommended):
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan cache:clear

AFTER RUNNING THE MIGRATION:
===========================

Your airport transfer booking should work perfectly! The booking form will now:
- âœ… Accept flight number input (optional field)
- âœ… Save all airport transfer data correctly
- âœ… Create user accounts during booking
- âœ… Send proper success/error responses

VERIFICATION:
============

To verify the fix worked:
1. Go to your website's airport transfer booking
2. Fill out the form completely
3. Try submitting the booking
4. You should see a success message with booking reference

If you see any errors after running the migration, check the Laravel logs at:
