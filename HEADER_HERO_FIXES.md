### 2. **Clear Cache**
Clear Laravel cache:

```

### 3. **Clear Browser Cache**
- Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache completely if issues persist

### 4. **Debug Carousel (if needed)**
Check browser console for debug messages:
- Look for "Carousel initialized" message
- Check element counts for slides, contents, and indicators
- Verify no JavaScript errors are shown

### 5. **Remove Debug Script**
After confirming everything works, remove the debug script from welcome.blade.php:
```php
<!-- Remove this line -->
<script src="{{ asset('js/carousel-debug.js') }}"></script>
```

## Key Features Now Working

1. **Smooth Carousel**
   - Auto-plays every 5 seconds
   - Manual navigation with arrow buttons
   - Click indicators to jump to specific slides
   - Pauses on hover (desktop only)

2. **Dynamic Header**
   - Subtle initial background for text readability
   - Smooth transition to blurred background on scroll
   - Enhanced shadow effect when scrolled
   - Maintains visibility at all times

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Optimized for all screen sizes
   - Mobile-friendly navigation
   - Proper text sizing on small screens
   - Touch-friendly controls

## Troubleshooting

If carousel still doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure all Blade components are properly included
3. Verify JavaScript is loading correctly
4. Check that Tailwind classes are compiled

If header background doesn't show on scroll:
1. Verify the header-bg element exists
2. Check JavaScript console for errors
3. Ensure scroll event listeners are attached

## Additional Notes

- The header now has a gradient background initially for better visibility
- Carousel transitions are smoother with proper z-index management
- All animations use GPU-accelerated CSS for better performance
- The design maintains the modern, professional appearance while fixing functionality
